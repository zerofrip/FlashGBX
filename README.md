  - SuperChis Prime internal SuperFW firmware flash (EXPERIMENTAL)¹

*¹ = Cannot always be auto-detected, select cartridge type manually*

*The SuperChis Prime profile is for internal SuperFW firmware flash only; it is not for game ROMs or SRAM. A backup -> restore -> backup round-trip of a real 2 MiB SuperFW firmware image (SHA-256 verified identical before and after) plus a normal boot of the cartridge after restoring has been confirmed on real SuperChis Prime hardware. Beyond that specific round-trip, this profile is still lightly tested: it must be selected manually (no auto-detection, no flash ID check), and only 2 MiB images containing the signature `SUPERFW~DAVIDGF` at offset 0xF0 are accepted for writing — do not override the ROM/backup size for this profile, since the SuperChis Prime's internal flash is only reachable as a 32 MiB window at most via the GBA cart bus's standard WS0/WS1/WS2 mirrors, and this profile does not implement the cart's NOR bank-switching, so anything read or written beyond the first few MiB is meaningless mirrored/open-bus data, not real additional content. Writing performs a full chip erase, which may also erase any NOR games stored on the cart (full bank-switching support covering the rest of the NOR chip, including stored games, has not been implemented). The cartridge is left write-enabled after each operation; power-cycle it afterwards. Copy the `.txt` profile to the FlashGBX config directory manually. The chip erase timeout is set to 2400 s as a conservative upper bound; real erase duration has not been separately measured.*

Many different reproduction cartridges share their flash chip command set, so even if yours is not on this list, it may still work fine or even be auto-detected as another one. Support for more cartridges can also be added by creating external config files that include the necessary flash chip commands.

## Downloads

In the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/Lesserkuma/FlashGBX/releases) section, downloadable packages are available for Windows, Linux and macOS.

### **Windows**
- x64 (.zip archive): Extract to a folder of your choice and run FlashGBX without having to install anything.
- x64 Setup package: Adds the application to the start menu and optionally creates a desktop icon, also includes device drivers.

> [!NOTE]
> These builds require the 64-bit version of Windows 11 or Windows 10.<br>*(Users of Windows 8 and Windows 7 can install the very old [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/) and run `pip install FlashGBX[qt5]` + `python -m FlashGBX`.)*

### **Linux**
- x86-64/arm64 (.AppImage file): A portable standalone package. Just add execute permissions via `chmod +x /path/to/FlashGBX-*_Linux-*.AppImage`.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to give yourself permissions to access the cartridge reader/writer hardware using one of the following methods.
> * Permanent system-wide permissions via udev rules (e.g. /etc/udev/rules.d/50-flashgbx.rules):<br>`SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7523", MODE="0666"`<br>`SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5740", MODE="0666"`<br>`SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209", ATTRS{idProduct}=="B010", MODE="0666"`<br>Then run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`.
> * Permanent user account permissions via user group:<br>`sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` or `sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER`<br>Then logout or reboot.
> * Temporary permissions:<br>`sudo chmod 0666 /dev/ttyUSB0` (replace with actual device path)

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a GBxCart RW or GBFlash, you may need to uninstall the `brltty` package to resolve CH340/341 driver conflicts.

### **macOS** *(Sequoia 15 or newer)*
- x86-64/arm64 (.dmg file): Install by opening the .dmg file and copying over “FlashGBX” to the desktop or applications folder.

> [!NOTE]
> If the application doesn’t run, it probably got quarantined due to the lack of a Apple Developer Program certificate. Extract the FlashGBX app from the .dmg file, then right-click the extracted FlashGBX icon, choose “Open Terminal at Folder” and enter this command to unquarantine it: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ../FlashGBX.app`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a Joey Jr, you will have run the separate [Joey Jr Firmware Updater](https://github.com/Lesserkuma/JoeyJr_FWUpdater) before using FlashGBX on macOS. Otherwise, FlashGBX will not be able to find your Joey Jr.

## Run via Python

FlashGBX can also be run in a local Python environment like so:

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt window
3. FlashGBX install commands:<br>
`python3 -m venv FlashGBX`<br>
`source FlashGBX/bin/activate`<br>
`wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py`<br>
`python3 get-pip.py`<br>
`python3 -m pip install "FlashGBX[qt6]"` (or `[qt5]` if it fails)<br>
`deactivate`<br>
4. FlashGBX launch commands:<br>
`source FlashGBX/bin/activate`<br>
`python3 -m FlashGBX`<br>

* To upgrade to the latest version, use the following commands:<br>`source FlashGBX/bin/activate`<br>`python3 -m pip install -U FlashGBX`

### Steam Deck

1. Boot your Steam Deck in Desktop Mode.
2. Open System Settings → Users.
3. Set a password for your user account (“deck”), if you do not have one set yet. (Make sure you do not forget this password in the future.)
4. Create a new folder where you want to install FlashGBX.
5. Right click the folder and select “Open Terminal Here”.
6. Enter the **install commands** from the “Run via Python” section.
7. Run `sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER` to give yourself the necessary hardware access permissions.<br>
(You may need to enter the password you set earlier.)
8. Restart your Steam Deck.
9. Enter the **launch commands** from the “Run via Python” section to run FlashGBX.

## Troubleshooting

* If some features don’t work as expected, first try to clean the game cartridge contacts (best with IPA 99.9%+ on a cotton swab) and reconnect the device. An unstable cartridge connection is the most common reason for read or write errors. Also try different USB ports and cables.

* If your *Game Boy Camera* cartridge is not reading, make sure it’s connected the correct way around; screws go up.

* Database checks will only work for genuine, unmodified game cartridges.

* When using reproduction/bootleg cartridges, hit “Analyze Flash Cart” before performing Backup ROM or Save Data functions.

* When you see the message “The ROM was written and verified successfully!”, that means FlashGBX’s job completed without errors. Any problems that occur when using the cartridge afterwards are linked to incompatibilities between cartridge hardware and ROM file.

  * In case of save type mismatch, use the “Analyze Flash Cart” feature or open up the cartridge and check for save memory chips to determine your cartridge save type, and compare with these spradsheets: [GBA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-a3qDDkJJNpaYOEXi-xgTv-j1QznXHt9rTUJNFshjo), [GB/GBC](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZnwTW_Y6anh1wLD6EkB5gZT6WHKckGOgPxO6x0fCDo).

  * If the save data detection says “512K FLASH (64 KiB) or 1M FLASH (128 KiB)”, that means the size can not be determined until actual save data is written to the cartridge.

  * If the save data detection says something like “1M FLASH (128 KiB) (Unlicensed ···)”, try the [Custom 1M FLASH Patcher](https://github.com/Lesserkuma/Custom_1M_FLASH_Patcher).

  * If your reproduction/bootleg cartridge has an SRAM memory chip but no battery, it was not designed for unmodified ROM files and you will need a “Batteryless SRAM” patch. It’s often a lost cause, but you can try the [GBA ROM Patcher website](https://www.gbarompatcher.com/).

* If you use a GBxCart RW and it resets itself while connecting to some Game Boy cartridges, this can be caused by a GBxCart RW hardware issue. As a workaround, try hotplugging the cartridge: Disable the “Automatic cartridge power off” setting, then click Connect → Game Boy → *Insert Cartridge* → Refresh.

## Miscellaneous

* To use your own frame around extracted Game Boy Camera pictures, place a file called `pc_frame.png` (must be at least 160×144 pixels) into the `config` directory. (GUI mode only)

* To write only the differences between two ROMs, name the original one `<name>.gba` and the edited one `<name>.delta.gba`.

* Translating FlashGBX to another language is possible using the free [Poedit software](https://poedit.com/). Load the `messages.pot` file and save your translation as a `<lang>.po` file. Contributions and pull requests are welcome.
